First off, I must admit this is a very thought-provoking question for me, even though I know how I got here, I mean how i ended up in Learn-verified, it has still taken me sometime to reflect back to where the urge and desire to be a software engineer began. But, how will the story be complete without telling you a bit about myself?

I am Johnson from Nigeria, residing in New York. Having arrived the U.S about two and half years ago, I was confronted with the question of what  to do after  deciding not to pursue my soccer carreer anymore. I dug deep down my heart looking for what can keep me on my toes.
I love being active. I'm not the kind of person you put in an office filing papers, it will bore me to death.

I tried to do something in the health industry only to find out that is not for me, I got bored in those classes easily.
Then I decided to do something in the tech industry which was a difficult choice for me then because I had no background in technology at all.
I was scared initially, but I went for it anyway. 

My first exposure to the technology world was through COMPTIA A+ and N+ classes which really assisted me a lot. But, I found my desires growing each day to do something higher and more impactful in the industry rather than just being a technician. I really felt I could do something more creative in the technology industry and I believed I could do it, I still believe though.

I took some free front-end web development classes from coursera which was a very good experience for me but I was not satisfied to just be a front-end developer. Out of nowhere, I found myself paying attention to applications development, honestly believe me I can't tell you where the desire came from. But, when I got to know it has something to do with programming I kind of got scared and just talked myself out of it.

But, no matter how hard I tried, the desire kept coming back. I was always drifting into google searching for how to learn programming for free,  I thought I had to go to college to learn it and it has to be through Computer Science until a friend of mine, who knew my interest in software development, sent me a Flatiron school link.

After several months of hesitation, borne out of fear, I finally made up my mind to sign up for the course which has been the best decision I have evermade in my life so far. Though it has not been all rosy and my speed has not been what I would have loved it to be, still, I am very happy for taking the bold step when I consider where I was a year ago and where I am now.

I am very proud of my success so far. You can never know how proud and joyous I was when I completed the TicTacToe with AI. It might not really mean anything to many but it means a lot to me.
 
 So back to the question, why do i really want to become a software engineer?
The very thought of making things with my own hands which people can really benefit from is the driving force behind my resolve to becoming a     software engineer.
I know I have a long way to go to realize this dream but I have made up my mind this is what I want to do and this is what I am going to do.



Thanks.
