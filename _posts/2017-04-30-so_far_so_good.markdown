When I decided to enroll for this program, I never thought it would be easy. Honestly speaking, I believed this would be the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life, considering my technology background. But, it's being more challenging than I imagined and also it's being more interesting than I ever thought.

The joy of building something that, at least works, makes all the pains and difficulties encountered worthwhile. The code might not be perfect, the indentation could be wrong but, I'm always happy to see things I build by myself and  take delight in what I've gained and learned  so far.

Talking about lessons learnt from my Rails project, for the first time in my programming journey, I had to dig deep on my own looking for solutions to challenges. I got to a point where I couldn't get a desired answer to my challenge from online reources (stackoverflow, etc.). The answers provided online did not solve the issue so, I had to come up with a solution by myself which after days of trying to figure it out, I definitely solved it on my own. I found myself thinking about these issues while at work, sleeping and walking they would dominate my thought life until I solved them. This happened about three times on the project.

What I discovered is that, like Luke told me during the Sinatra assessment, "you are learning a lot but you won't know until you're faced with a challenge in your coding" I didn't know if he were just encouraging me because, my belief was on the contrary, as I still struggle with some basic concepts. But, I think Luke was right, there are stuffs I've learnt and digested but didn't know they're there until there was a need to use them and even when I struggled all I had to do was to go back to the program's materials.

Notwitstanding, online resources was of tremendous help for me during my Rails project also. For implementing Omniauth with devise, it was really challenging to implement that feaure. But, after spending more time googling around, I was able to make it work. 

All in all, it was a wonderful experience for me and like I mentioned above, I'm very happy with what I've learnt and done so far. I know I still have a very long way to go to be ready, still, I take joy in my current achievements and they motivate me to keep learning and loving coding.
