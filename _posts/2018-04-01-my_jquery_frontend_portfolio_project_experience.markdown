Having spent a great deal of time in the curriculum learning Ruby as my first programming language, it was a challenging task learning javascript with along with other subjects featured in the section.

In all honesty, it was really confusing and took going through the section twice before I started having an understanding of it, though I still have a lot of work to do.

But nevertheless, it's been an amazing and wonderful learning experience going from one programming langauge to another.

Talking about my project, it took me longer thanI anticipated to complete it as I had to overcome many hurdles along the line, not without the help of the amazing Learn Technical coaches. It's during this project I've learnt more and became more knowledgable about some subjects specifically API and Object Oriented Javascript which I really struggled with during the course.

While this has taken a lot longer than I would've wanted, I'm very encouraged with the knowledge gained and the progress made so far.
