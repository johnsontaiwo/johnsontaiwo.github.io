 The thought of making my first simple application was scary but, having gone through the fwitter lab, the task became a bit easier that initially thought.
 
 The application is a customized construction agency software that can be used to store information about every project the agency has and has excuted.
 The application also has in its database the list of all contractors that are either working or have worked with the agency.
 
 For access to the software, an account must be created for an authorized user who will have access to all the information contained in the database of the software. The user must be authorized because all the information contained in the database are personal and confidential as such we do not want an unauthorized user to have access to the software.
 
 The layout of the application is very simple and self-explanatory. The authorized user can easily navigate through it.
 
 This is a very basic and simple application and I intend to add more features to it as I continue to learn more.
 For now am pleased to introduce my own-made application to all.
