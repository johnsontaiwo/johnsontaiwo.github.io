Html has some very useful and powerful elements that make the job easier for developers.
As a new and curious developer, I came across some of these powerful elements online and will like to share some knowledge with you.

I want to talk about html quotation elements. The html quotation elements are of two types.
The <q> is used for short quotations while <blockquote> is used for long quotations.
Browsers usually insert quotation marks around the <q> element. While <blockquote> elements are usually indented.

**Examples:**

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Browsers usually insert quotation marks around the q element.</p>

<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

</body>
</html>

**Result:**

Browsers usually insert quotation marks around the q element.

WWF's goal is to: Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.






<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Browsers usually indent blockquote elements.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.
