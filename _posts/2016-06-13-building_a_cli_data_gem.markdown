Having doubted my ability to complete this project for a while, I finally took the courage to embark on it. Truth be said, it was a very challenging and herculean task for me. But, in the long run I finally did it.

This has been my greatest challenge so far in this journey. Why? Because I have to come up with ideas and logic by myself. Also, I promised not to really reach out to anyone for help until I've exhausted every idea I could muster.Thankfully, it didn't get to that stage.

Without much ado, my cli data gem project provides a CLI for the top sixteen (16) most beautiful islands in the world,upon installation of the gem.

I must admit that the most challenging part of this project was the scrapping process,it was really challenging, owing to how the source site was designed.

Like I said, this has been my greatest challenge so far and I'm very happy with the completion of the project eventhough I recognize that the code could be tidier and more elegant than it is right now.

Thanks.
